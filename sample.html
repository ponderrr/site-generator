                <p>
                    Web development is an ever-evolving field that requires continuous learning and adaptation.
                    Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, these 10 essential tips will help
                    you write better code, improve your workflow, and build more robust web applications.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section class="content">
                <h2>1. Write Clean, Readable Code</h2>
                <p>
                    Clean code is easier to maintain and debug. Use meaningful variable names, add comments
                    where necessary, and follow consistent formatting throughout your project.
                </p>

                <h2>2. Use Version Control (Git)</h2>
                <p>
                    Version control is essential for tracking changes, collaborating with others, and managing
                    different versions of your project. Learn Git basics and make it a habit to commit regularly.
                </p>

                <h2>3. Test Your Code</h2>
                <p>
                    Writing tests helps catch bugs early and ensures your code works as expected. Start with
                    unit tests and gradually incorporate integration and end-to-end testing.
                </p>

                <h2>4. Optimize Performance</h2>
                <p>
                    Website performance directly impacts user experience and SEO. Minimize HTTP requests,
                    compress images, use lazy loading, and leverage browser caching.
                </p>

                <h2>5. Make It Responsive</h2>
                <p>
                    With mobile traffic accounting for over 50% of web usage, responsive design is no longer
                    optional. Use CSS Grid, Flexbox, and media queries to create layouts that work on all devices.
                </p>

                <h2>6. Focus on Accessibility</h2>
                <p>
                    Build websites that everyone can use. Use semantic HTML, provide alt text for images,
                    ensure keyboard navigation, and maintain sufficient color contrast.
                </p>

                <h2>7. Keep Security in Mind</h2>
                <p>
                    Security should be a priority from the start. Validate user input, use HTTPS, implement
                    proper authentication, and stay updated on common vulnerabilities like XSS and SQL injection.
                </p>

                <h2>8. Learn Modern JavaScript</h2>
                <p>
                    JavaScript continues to evolve with new features and best practices. Stay current with
                    ES6+ features like arrow functions, async/await, destructuring, and modules.
                </p>

                <h2>9. Use Developer Tools</h2>
                <p>
                    Master your browser's developer tools for debugging, performance analysis, and testing.
                    Tools like Chrome DevTools can significantly speed up your development process.
                </p>

                <h2>10. Never Stop Learning</h2>
                <p>
                    The web development landscape changes rapidly. Follow industry blogs, contribute to
                    open source, attend conferences, and experiment with new technologies.
